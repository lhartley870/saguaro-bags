## Agile Methodology

## Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

* Initial list of short-tail keywords:

    * Vegan leather
    * Vegan leather bags
    * Cactus leather
    * Cactus leather bags
    * Eco leather 
    * Eco leather bags
    * Sustainable bags

* Additional keywords found by Google searching the initial list:

    * Keyword Searched: Vegan leather 
        * Vegan leather made from plants
        * Vegan leather bags
        * Vegan leather handbags
        * Vegan leather made from
    
    * Keyword Searched: Vegan leather bags
        * Affordable vegan handbags uk
        * Vegan leather handbags uk
        * Vegan leather bags uk
        * Vegan leather bags cactus
        * Vegan leather bags designer

    * Keyword Searched: Cactus leather
        * Where to buy cactus leather
        * Cactus leather uk
        * Cactus leather fabric
        * Is cactus leather biodegradable
        * Desserto cactus leather
        * Cactus leather manufacturers

    * Keyword Searched: Cactus leather bags
        * Vegan cactus bags
        * Handbags made from cactus
        * Cactus leather weekend bag
        * Where to buy cactus leather

    * Keyword Searched: Eco leather
        * Eco leather vs real leather
        * Eco leather vs faux leather
        * Does eco leather last

    * Keyword Searched: Eco leather bags
        * Sustainable bags uk
        * Sustainable bags
        * Sustainable handbag brands
        * Sustainable tote bags

    * Keyword Searched: Sustainable bags
        * Sustainable bags uk
        * Sustainable bag brands

    * Keyword Searched: Sustainable handbags
        * Sustainable handbags uk
        * Sustainable bag brands
        * Sustainable leather bags
        * Vegan sustainable handbags 

* Considering relevance
    * List of keywords narrowed down to exclude the following:
        * The website probably doesn't meet the need behind the following keyword searches as they appear to be more to do with people wanting to buy the cactus leather itself, possible for manufacturing their own products:
            * Where to buy cactus leather
            * Cactus leather fabric
            * Cactus leather manufacturers
        * While the website does mention that cactus leather is partially biodegradable, the site's purpose does not include a detailed account of the properties of cactus leather:
            * Is cactus leather biodegradable
            * Does eco leather last
        * As the site offers a variety of bags, it is perhaps not that helpful to use keywords for specific bag types:
            * Cactus leather weekend bag
            * Sustainable tote bags
        * These keywords are going to be too generic:
            * Vegan leather made from plants
            * Cactus leather uk
            * Vegan leather made from
            * Eco leather vs real leather
            * Eco leather vs faux leather
            * Sustainable bags uk
            * Sustainable bags
            * Sustainable handbag brands
            * Sustainable bags uk
            * Sustainable bag brands
            * Sustainable handbags uk
            * Sustainable bag brands
            
    * Desserto cactus leather has been left in as a relevant keywords because the home page specifically mentions them as a cactus leather manufacturer and includes a link to their website.

* Considering authority
    * Saguaro bags can speak from a place of authority about the following keywords as it is a store selling vegan cactus leather designer bags at an affordable price:
        * Vegan leather bags
        * Vegan leather handbags
        * Affordable vegan handbags uk
        * Vegan leather handbags uk
        * Vegan leather bags uk
        * Vegan leather bags cactus
        * Vegan leather bags designer        
        * Vegan cactus bags
        * Handbags made from cactus
        * Sustainable leather bags
        * Vegan sustainable handbags 
    * Also, being as the site includes information about Desserto's cactus leather and a link to their home page, it can also speak from a place of authority about Desserto:
        * Desserto cactus leather
        
* Considering volume
    * Using the [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/) website for searching a number of the above keywords, the following helpful results were found where the balance between a high volume of searches and a reasonable volume of competition was good:

        Keyword | Volume | Competition
        ------------| --------- | ---------
        Vegan designer bags | 1,650 | 5.63
        Cactus leather bag | 383 | -
        Cactus leather handbags | 114 | -
        Desserto leather | 619 | -

* The final keywords list chosen is:
    * Vegan leather bags
    * Vegan designer bags
    * Affordable vegan handbags uk
    * Vegan leather bags cactus
    * Cactus leather bag
    * Cactus leather handbags
    * Desserto cactus leather
    * Desserto leather
    * Sustainable leather bags
              
* The keywords were implemented in the site as follows:
    * Putting h1 and h2 tags in the overlay to the home page hero image and using keywords within these tags.
    * Using keywords in the home page information section headings and in strong tags within the information paragraphs themselves.
    * Adding an external link to the home page to a Guardian article on living more sustainably.
    * Including a footer link to a vegan charity and using the word vegan in the link text and aria-label.
    * Including a link to Desserto's homepage, a leading manufacturer of cactus leather who rank well in keyword searches.
    * Including all the keywords in the meta keywords tag content attribute.
    * All of the alt attributes for the 50 bags being sold on the site include the words 'cactus leather'.

* Ideally I would have liked to refer to Desserto as a partner on the home page, but being as the site is not a real e-commerce site and has not partnered with Desserto, I have refrained from doing this. However, were this a real site that had partnered with Desserto, then I would include further references to them to improve the SEO.
